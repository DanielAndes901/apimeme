                Cookies are pieces of data that a website transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
                Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage,
                e-mail response and tracking.
                Generally, cookies may contain information about your Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, the region or
                general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type, operating system
                and other usage information about the website or your usage of our services, including a history of the
                pages you view.

            <p class="text-black mb-5">
                APIMeme collects information from cookies and web beacons and stores it in an internal
                database. This information is retained in accordance with our Privacy Policy. This website uses the

                Strictly Necessary Cookies
            </h6>

            <p class="text-black mb-5">
                These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They
                are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as
                setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can configure your browser to
                block or alert you about these cookies, but certain areas of the site will not function properly. These
                cookies do not store any personal data.

                Performance Cookies and Web Beacons
            </h6>

            <p class="text-black mb-5">
                These cookies and web beacons allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve
                the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how
                visitors move around the site. All information that these cookies and web beacons collect is aggregated
                and, therefore, anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies and web beacons our aggregated statistics
                will not have a record of your visit.

                The website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google
                Analytics uses cookies to help analyse how you use this website. The information generated by the cookie
                about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google
                on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purposes of evaluating your
                use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other
                services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to
                third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on
                Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

                These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set
                by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these

                Targeting Cookies and Web Beacons
            </h6>

            <p class="text-black mb-5">
                These cookies and web beacons may be set throughout our site by our advertising partners. They may be
                used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on
                other sites. They do not store personal information that could identify you directly, but are based on
                uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies and web
                beacons, you will experience less targeted advertising. The website does not track users when they cross
                to third party websites, does not provide targeted advertising to them and therefore does not respond to
                Do Not Track ("DNT") signals.
